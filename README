chem: collection of mostly python code for molecular visualization and QM/MM calculations.  Intended for interactive use from standard python prompt.

Getting started:
- see misc/chem-inst.sh for setup on Debian or related Linux distros
- see "Preparation" section in projects/trypsin1.py; then from the folder containing 1MCT-trimI.pdb, at a Python prompt, run `execfile('<path to this repo>/projects/trypsin1.py')`
- see "Examples" section in vis/chemvis.py for standalone visualization examples

Major features:
- 3D visualization of molecular geometry and orbitals
 - fast OpenGL volume and isosurface rendering
 - oriented toward analysis and debugging of calculations rather than presentation
- QM/MM driver supporting electrostatic embedding with various charge shifting schemes
- DLC/HDLC/Redundant internal coordinates
- read/write .pdb, TINKER, GAMESS and NWChem files

Requirements:
- Python 2.7 w/ scipy and numpy
- https://github.com/cclib/cclib - for reading GAMESS and NWChem output
- https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf - for MO visualization and basis sets for some GAMESS calculations
- TINKER - https://dasher.wustl.edu/tinker/ - molecular mechanics calculations
- GAMESS (US) or NWChem - quantum chemistry calculations
